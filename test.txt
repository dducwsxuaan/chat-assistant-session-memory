**** LONG CONTEXT INPUT ****

You may input the long context once, as it may not be ambiguous.

1. I’m structuring a 3-year capital-protected note for high-net-worth clients in Europe linked to a basket of major tech stocks, with 100% principal protection at maturity and at least 70% upside participation, but current high interest rates and elevated implied volatility are making the option component expensive; the product must comply with PRIIPs, remain competitive versus a simple ETF investment, allow manageable hedging costs for the issuer, and ideally support some secondary market liquidity—given these constraints, how should the payoff be engineered (e.g., bond + call structure, capped upside, barrier features, cliquet elements, or basket optimization) to balance capital protection, participation, regulatory transparency, and risk management?

2. I manage a multi-asset portfolio with 60% global equities, 30% investment-grade bonds, and 10% alternatives, but with persistent inflation, inverted yield curves, and rising geopolitical risk, I’m concerned about drawdown exposure over the next 12–18 months; given constraints of moderate risk tolerance, quarterly liquidity needs, and regulatory limits on leverage, how should I adjust asset allocation, duration exposure, and hedging strategies (e.g., options, commodities, TIPS, or volatility products) to improve risk-adjusted returns without materially increasing volatility?

3. A 58-year-old patient with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and stage 2 chronic kidney disease presents with worsening fatigue, mild peripheral edema, and HbA1c of 8.4% despite metformin therapy; blood pressure is 148/92 mmHg on an ACE inhibitor, eGFR is 68 mL/min/1.73m², and BMI is 31—considering cardiovascular risk reduction, renal protection, glycemic control, and potential drug interactions, how should treatment be optimized, and what additional diagnostics or medication adjustments should be considered?

4. I’m building a real-time object detection system for traffic monitoring using edge devices with limited GPU memory (8GB), and the model must detect vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists in low-light and adverse weather conditions at 30 FPS; given constraints on latency, power consumption, dataset imbalance, and the need for high precision in pedestrian detection to reduce false negatives, which model architecture (e.g., YOLO variants, EfficientDet, transformer-based detectors), training strategies (data augmentation, transfer learning, quantization), and deployment optimizations should I prioritize?



**** AMBIGUOUS INPUT ****

For each of ambiguous query, you may answer the clarified questions generated by the chat assistant.

1. Can we switch it to that instead, or would it break the previous setup?


2. Is it compatible with what we decided to use earlier?

3. Where can we cut costs without affecting performance too much?
